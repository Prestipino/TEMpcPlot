The package includes also GUI´s to perform Linear Combination Fit, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Iterative Target Transformation Factor Analysis (ITTFA), a procedure to align theoretical components obtained from PCA analysis to the experimentally measured. The main benefit of this code is allow to follow in real time the evolution of time- or space-resolved experiments coming from Quick-EXAFS (QEXAFS) and dispersive EXAFS beamlines. The present version the software adopted a flexible general input  method for ASCII files.\r\n\r\nThe parameter selection for XANES, EXAFS, and FT is interactive \r\n\r\n![exafs1](https://github.com/soonready/PrestoPronto/blob/gh-pages/images/EXAFS1.png)\r\n\r\n### Download Releases\r\nInstallation files could be download [here](https://github.com/soonready/PrestoPronto/releases)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCarmelo Prestipino (@Prestipino)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
