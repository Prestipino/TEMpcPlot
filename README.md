# TEMpcPlot

## Introduction
The library TEMpcPlot has as object the treatments of a Sequence of electropn diffraction cliches to obtain a three dimensional redcipriocal lattice. The idea behind is to find a way of work for TEM, available on pc, with graphycal approach (TEMpcPlot)

The library is divided in two main class
** TEMpcPlot.SeqIm **
    a sequence of image where each element of the class is an image

** EwaldPeaks **
    Set of peaks position and intensity
    this class manages peaks position and intensity and the methods related to
    lattice indexing and refinement
    could be created as an attribute EwP of a SeqIm class by using methods D3_peaks
    or by sum with an another EwaldPeaks class with the same first image

## Step by step instructions for installation
- install anaconda or miniconda(https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- open an anaconda prompt on the start menu
- type:
```bash
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```
- type: 
```bash
conda install ipython
```
- type:
```bash
conda install -c cprestip tempcplot
```

## UPDATE
The code is still in rapid change and could present several bug
please update with the following command on an anaconda prompt  
```bash
conda update -c cprestip --force-reinstall tempcplot
```
 alternativelly for small update without complete compile version online, it is possible to dowload the package, and execute
 ```python setup.py install```

## In order to work
- create a text file  \*.sqi containing the name of files with the tilts angles in the working directory

      Example \*.sqi:
      # comment 
      UOs025Ge2_02juin21_0006.dm3    3.3  3.3
      UOs025Ge2_02juin21_0007.dm3    6.7  1.6
      UOs025Ge2_02juin21_0008.dm3    9.4  0.4

- open an anaconda prompth in the start menu
- type:
```bash
cd working_dir
```

- chande disk if necessary i.e. C: or D:

- type:
```bash
ipython
```

- type:
```bash
import TEMpcPlot as TP 
```

- create the SeqIm object
> Exp1 = TP.SeqIm('filename.sqi')

If you are uysing ipython remenber that after a dot a tap press show all the available methods

## Typical sequence of commands
The mode of use is relativelly simple :
create a SeqIm object

> Ex1 = TEMpcPlot.SeqIm('cr2.sqi') \
construct a seq
> Ex1.plot()

> Ex1.D3_peaks(tollerance=15)

### Index automatically 
> Ex1.EwP.find_cell()   
find primitive cell with minimal translation\

### Index manually the reciprocal space
> Ex1.EwP.plot()
reconstruct reciprocal space and plot in a graph attribute
more information on the [wiki](https://github.com/Prestipino/TEMpcPlot/wiki/EwaldPeaks)

> Ex1.EwP.set_cell()
take in account the recipriocal cell

> Ex1.Ewp.create_layer(hkl)
